# Financier

AI-powered personal finance management API

## ⚠️ Work in progress

As much as I love to work on this project fulltime, I still have a job that I love.

## 🧠 What is it?

Basically a glorified bookkeeper, financial coach, and financial manager.
I wanted to leverage the use of OpenAI models to create an assistant that will:

- keep track of my expenses
- generate reports
- remind me of a money-related event
- make me feel good about my financial health (or not)

### Features

1. 📃 Create, list, read, update, delete income and expense items.
2. 📸 Upload a photo of a receipt and let the assistant book it for you.
3. 📈 Generate daily, monthly, yearly reports of your finances.
4. 💪🏽Set budgets (daily and weekly).
5. 📨 Receive emails about alerts and notifications.
6. ⛰️ Set financial goals.
7. 👨🏽 Ask the assistant about your finances.
